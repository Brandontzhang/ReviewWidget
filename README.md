# ReviewWidget

## Description
Purpose of this widget is to create a tool for reviewing material learned. The user can input questions or facts they have come across, along with a priority. 
They will also be able to query for a question that they have previously entered. The widget will randomly select a question based on the time since that
question/fact was last reviewed as well as it's assigned priority. 

## Technology Stack
### Backend
- MongoDB Atlas - I decided to use a noSQL database so that the types of questions we can add in the future don't require constant updates to a DB table
- Spring/Java

### Frontend
- React 
- Ant Design
